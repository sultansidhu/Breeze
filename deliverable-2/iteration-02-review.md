## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: March 7th, 2020
 * Where: In person at Bahen.

## Process - Reflection


#### Decisions that turned out well

<!-- List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s). -->
* One decision that turned out to be highly successful was the decision to spend extensive time making high level design decisions, such as decisions about data storage and retrieval, as well as the complicated decisions regarding parking lot rate options. We also frequently sought the advice of our partner especially in the beginning stages of our coding with regard to features and properties of our application. Finally, we took advantage of TA help to better understand some of the designs of data storage, and to get feedback on several existing designs which we were considering. While we did spend a significant amount of time on these decisions, we reaped the benefits of this, as it saved us time when we were implementing features of our application, and made our overall process smoother.
* The other decision that turned out fairly well was the split between teams working on front-end, backend, and database. Within each of the teams, decisions were generally made cohesively and collaboratively. Additionally, having subteams specialize in database design, front end and UI design, and backend made the code in these sections more cohesive as there were fewer people working on the same sections of code. This reduced the overlap of functionality between different functions. Most importantly, because the aesthetics were designed by one subteam, the pages in the app consequently looked more similar, with a similar style - a very important thing!

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

<!-- List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s). -->
* The decision of having an open Trello board where people could take on tasks whenever they had time made it easier for work to pile up towards the end of the timeframe.
* Having meetings only once every 1-2 weeks made it too easy for members who were away for a few days to fall behind and be unable to catch up/understand what had been done. Additionally, it was more difficult for people in different subteams to be up to date on the work of each other.
* The decision to have open meetings where people could ask for help and talk about their problems with the code was not that successful, as it made meetings disorganized and those who didnâ€™t have as much to talk about with their contributions had little to say/do. It would have been better to make sure that in each meeting, each subteam discussed in detail their progress, and to have a focus on making sure that the subteams had a good idea of what the other sub teams were doing.

#### Planned changes

<!-- List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change. -->
* One change that we have been discussing is the method in which items are assigned on the Trello board. Currently, we have a system where people self-assign tasks whenever they are available, which provides more freedom but makes the pace of work extremely uneven and disorganized. Additionally, it becomes more difficult to predict when tasks will be started and completed. Instead, we have discussed the idea of assigning tasks once a week (at one of our team meetings), where we assign tasks to each member which are to be done by the end of the week. This will have the benefit of making the progress smoother, allow team members to be more accountable for their work and allow other teams to better predict when tasks/features will be complete.
* Another change that we have discussed is to have more frequent meetings. Currently, we have meetings every 1-2 weeks. This has worked to some extent, but some team members have reported falling behind with where others are in the process of producing a feature/product, and all of us have occasionally felt confused about what we should do next. In particular, at times there has been insufficient communication between members/subteams. More frequent meetings can be a solution to these issues, as they will allow us to keep up with what we have to do, what others have done, and our overall progress towards our goals. We will come to an agreement based on the nature of these meetings (in person/online) and exact days of the week. These meetings will have a focus on debriefing from all subteams, assignment of new jobs, and any other miscellaneous tasks/decisions which require the entire group.
* Finally, we have thought about adjusting the labour assigned to different sections of the application. We observed that while there was plenty of labour for the database and sufficient labour for the backend functions, we did not allot as much time as we would have liked for the deployment, and frontend development. We may change that for the next deliverable, to ensure that all parts of the application get sufficient attention.



## Product - Review

<!-- #### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Were there change requests?
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed* -->
* We launched it to Azure, we showed our signup as user, signup as plm, login, dashboard and enter pricing for parking lots and out partner is happy with all that. The partner said: The site looks great! Easy to navigate, core functions well presented, sign-up process is straightforward and logical.
